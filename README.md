# Squirrel Sightings Web App

This file is written to describe the tools and features of this web application.

## Features
This Django-based web app keeps track of all recorded sightings found in Central Park in 2018. All data was retrieved from the [2018 US Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw). This dataset contains 3023 squirrel sightings, of which 3018 are unique. Users of the app can add, edit or delete a squirrel sighting. Additionally, general statistics of the sightings, and a map that visualizes the geographical locations of the sightings can be found. 

## Installation
Clone this repository into your project with the following:
```bash
git@github.com:shinler/squirrels.git
```
## Management Commands
These commands allow you to import and export the dataset: 

> **Import**: Import the data from the 2018 census file in CSV format. The file path should be specified at the command line after the name of the management command.

```bash

```

> **Export**: Export the data in CSV format. The file path should be specified at the command line after the name of the management command.

- Django   (2.2.7)
- pytz     (2019.3)
- sqlparse (0.3.0)

## Additional Notes
* Plotting more than 100 sightings at once may cause the map to freeze
* Duplicates of squirrel IDs were not imported into the database
* If a field in the form is filled in incorrectly (e.g. non-existent date), the application will stay at the sightings/add page and will not be able to post a new sighting successfully
* If a new sighting was added successfully, the user is redirected back to the sightings page
